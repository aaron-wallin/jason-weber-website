        <div class="cbp-l-inline-subtitle">by Jason Weber</div>

        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">New 2013 release from saxophonist Jason Weber. This is the long awaited baritone sax feature album from this talented artist. Aggressive, funky & a unique approach to this under-utilized member of the saxophone family! “In Too Deep” is saxophonist Jason Weber’s 8th CD release. Unlike Weber’s previous work, this album is exclusively a baritone saxophone feature. “I feel the bari is an under-utilized voice, except when holding down the bottom end of a horn section like Doc Kupka in Tower of Power”, Weber explains. “Typically it’s tenor, alto or soprano handling the melodies & solos. There are some obvious exceptions with albums by some great bari players like Pepper Adams, Ronnie Cuber & Gerry Mulligan, but their music is primarily straight ahead jazz. This album has more of a funky, contemporary vibe. I also wanted to showcase the extended altissimo range of the bari on several of the cuts which is also something that you don’t hear often enough. It has a very cool, fat texture that you can’t get on tenor &amp; alto.”</div>
